    %p I'm lenny. I'm a software engineer who lives in the Pacific Northwest. Professionally, I write code. I care a lot about my users' needs, and I believe in using good engineering practices to support these needs. You can never be a perfect person or write perfect code, but you can build a robust system of processes that finds problems before they reach your end user.

    %p In my personal life, I like to express my creative side. I create music, paint, knit, cross-stitch...I've tried most fiber arts that I've heard of. I have two very small cats and two very large dogs, and they're all named after fighter pilots on the Battlestar Galactica, because I'm a big nerd too.

    %p This is my personal website. It's not much, but it's mine.

    %p If you have further questions or concerns, you can reach me at lenny.n.wondra@gmail.com
